# Prerequisites #

A Linux/Windows/OSX server that's always running. (I host this program on a free google cloud debian server)

A Discord Webhook (see info [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks))

# Running with docker #
Just pull the image and mount a volume into ``/data`` directory to keep latest state of processes posts.
If you miss this volume it's not that important. If you restart the container the latest post get posted again.
